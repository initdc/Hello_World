# Hello_World

Hi Humans

Even's here, I'm learning how to work at coding of C.
Last day,I even didn't know how to use the GitHub, neither now.
I regret that I didn't study hard at English, forgive my poor English.

Waiting for Anna.

Now I know how to sync the code from GitHub, I understand ssh git clone sudo apt repo tsinghua key hide ...

I feel good, it's really not bad.Good job.

Pushing the file to the GitHub is really not easy for me, ORZ.
Boss is coming,I think I have to close the VMware, tired but happy.

See, I learn many things from code cademy. The man who built this web is so great.
It's fanny, but not be interesting.

I'm still learning, I don't want forget it, something named my habit.
